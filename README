ScreenTicket.
-------------

ScreenTicket is a ESC/POS ticket printer emulator, for GNU/Linux, to show tickets on screen to avoid wasting paper when you
are testing any Point of Sale software.

It's writing in C++ with Qt library.


The printing system used in GNU/Linux is CUPS. To use ScreenTicket you need to create a new "raw" printer and redirect it
to a file (e.g. /tmp/printer1.prn). Previously, you need to configure CUPS to allow this behaviour:

Edit /etc/cups/cupsd.conf and add this directive:

    FileDevice Yes


Save and restart CUPS to take effect.


Current version:
----------------

    1.0.0


Dependencies:
-------------

You need the following Software to compile the source code:

    Qt 4.7+


Compilation:
------------

    qmake
    make
    sudo make install


Todo:
-----

Now only shows text without format. Enough for testing, but improvements in WYSIWYG behaviour is the next objective.


Usage:
------

screenticket --file=<file> [--title=<title>]

Arguments:
  --file=FILE       File to monitor, like CUPS printer redirected to this file.
  --title=TITLE     Title to show at the top of the GUI layout.
  --version         Shows the version of the program.
  --help            Shows this help text.
